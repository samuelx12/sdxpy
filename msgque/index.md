**In Development**

When a web server processes an order,
it might need to notify the inventory system,
trigger an email,
update analytics,
and log the transaction.
If the web server calls each of these services directly,
a failure in any one could block the entire operation.
This is where message queues come in.

Systems like [RabbitMQ][rabbitmq], [Apache Kafka][kafka], and [Amazon SQS][amazon-sqs]
decouple message producers from consumers.
A publisher sends messages to a named topic without knowing who (if anyone) will receive them.
Subscribers express interest in topics and then receive messages asynchronously,
processing them at their own pace.

This lesson shows how to build a message delivery service using
the [%g publish-subscribe "publish-subscribe pattern" %].
The [%g message-broker "message broker" %] keeps track of which subscribers are interested in which topics.
When a message arrives,
it delivers it to them.
This is called [%g fan-out "fan-out" %]:
one message can reach many consumers.

Publish-subscribe is popular because
it [%g decoupling "decouples" %] publishers and subscribers.
They don't need to know about each other:
they only share knowledge of topic names,
which allows us to add more of either without modifying existing code.
In addition,
the broker provides [%g buffer "buffering" %]:
if consumers are slow or temporarily unavailable,
messages wait rather than being lost.

## Our Implementation {: #msgque-impl}

Our first implementation has three main components:
publishers that send messages,
a broker that routes messages to topics,
and subscribers that receive and process messages.
We start by defining a [%g dataclass "dataclass" %] to store a single message:

[%inc message.py mark=message %]

Each message belongs to a topic like "orders" or "user-activity",
and has some content, a unique ID, and a timestamp.
Messages in a real system would contain structured data (e.g., as [%g json "JSON" %]),
but strings are sufficient for our example.

The broker stores a dictionary called `topics` mapping topics to lists of queues:

[%inc broker.py mark=broker %]

<div class="callout" markdown="1">

`MessageBroker` isn't an active `Process`,
but it needs the [asimpy][asimpy] `Environment` to construct `Queue` objects.
We have also given it counters to record the number of of messages published and delivered.

</div>

When someone wants to be notified of messages,
it registers itself and gets a queue in return:

[%inc broker.py mark=subscribe %]

Using separate queues per subscriber ensures that a slow consumer doesn't block others,
which is a key property of the pattern.
Real-world message queue implementations would drop messages when queues fill up;
we will look at this later.

When a message is published,
the broker looks up the topic and places the message in each subscriber's queue:

[%inc broker.py mark=publish %]

To test this,
let's create a publisher that sends messages to a specific topic at some rate:

[%inc publisher.py mark=publisher %]

Real publishers would react to external events (like HTTP requests or database changes),
but timed generation works well for simulation.

Notice that we inherit from `Process`, which is asimpy's base class for active components.
As described in [the appendix](@/asimpy/),
the `init()` method is called during construction to set up our state,
while `run()` creates the coroutine that defines the publisher's behavior.

Finally, our simulated subscribers receive and process messages:

[%inc subscriber.py mark=subscriber %]

<div class="callout" markdown="1">

`Subscriber` uses [asimpy][asimpy]'s `FirstOf` to wait on multiple queues simultaneously.
Whichever queue has a message first will complete,
and all other requests will be canceled.
This is more elegant than [%g round-robin-polling "round-robin polling" %].
Real implementations use event-driven APIs or threads,
but `FirstOf` captures the same semantics.

</div>

## Running a Simulation {: #msgque-sim}

Let's create a scenario with multiple publishers and subscribers to see the system in action:

[%inc ex_simple.py mark=simulate %]

The output shows messages being published and consumed asynchronously:

[%inc ex_simple.out head=10 tail=6 %]

Notice how the fast `Inventory` service keeps up with orders,
while the slow `Email` service falls behind:
this is the buffering we mentioned earlier.
At the same time,
the `Analytics` service receives messages from multiple topics,
demonstrating how subscribers can aggregate different event streams.

## Backpressure and Flow Control {: #msgque-back}

So far, our broker uses unbounded queues that grow indefinitely.
This works in simulation but fails in production:
if publishers produce faster than subscribers consume,
queues will eventually exhaust memory and crash the system.
The solution is [%g backpressure "backpressure" %]:
a mechanism where slow consumers signal upstream components to slow down.
Backpressure is fundamental to building robust distributed systems.
Without it, a single slow consumer can cause cascading failures.

There are several strategies for implementing backpressure:

Bounded queues with blocking
:   Publishers block when queues are full, naturally slowing them down.
    This provides strong backpressure but can cause publishers to stall.

Bounded queues with dropping
:   When queues are full, new messages are dropped.
    This keeps the system running but loses data.
    This strategy is usually combined with metric collection and reporting
    so that operators know data is being lost.

Adaptive rate limiting
:   Publishers monitor queue sizes or delivery failures and dynamically adjust their publishing rate.
    This is more complex but provides smoother behavior under heavy load.

Priority-based dropping
:   When backpressure occurs, the system drops low-priority messages first
    in order to preserve critical data.

Let's implement bounded queues with message dropping and adaptive rate limiting.
The constructor takes an extra parameter `max_queue_size`:

[%inc backpressure_broker.py mark=backpressure %]

It uses this value to initialize queues:

[%inc backpressure_broker.py mark=subscribe %]

When a queue is full,
`publish()` drops the message for that subscriber
and returns `False` to signal backpressure to the publisher:

[%inc backpressure_broker.py mark=publish %]

Now we need a publisher that responds to backpressure.
Its constructor needs two new parameters:
a base interval to wait before re-trying a message,
and a [%g backoff-multiplier "backoff multiplier" %]
that tells it how to increase the interval if repeated attempts to publish fail:

[%inc backpressure_publisher.py mark=init %]

The publisher's `run()` method uses these two parameters to implement
[%g exponential-backoff "exponential backoff" %],
which is one of the most important concepts in distributed systems.
If an attempt to publish a message fails,
the publisher increases its interval between messages.
If publishing succeeds,
on the other hand,
it gradually reduces the interval back to the base rate.
This creates a [%g negative-feedback-loop "negative feedback loop" %] that stabilizes the system under load.

Let's see backpressure in action with one fast publisher,
one that's slow,
and and a deliberately small queue size:

[%inc ex_backpressure.py mark=sim %]

The full output shows that the publisher starts fast
but encounter backpressure as the slow subscriber's queue fills.
The publisher adapts by slowing down,
and the system reaches equilibrium where the publishing rate matches the consumption rate.

[%inc ex_backpressure.out head=10 tail=7 %]

## Message Priority {: #msgque-priority}

In most real systems, not all messages are equal.
As the system becomes overloaded,
we might want to preserve high-priority messages while dropping low-priority ones.
To implement this,
we start by adding a `priority` field to our messages:

[%inc priority_backpressure.py mark=message %]

When we publish a message,
we check queue-by-queue to see if there's room.
If not,
we either evict a lower-priority message or discard the one that just arrived:

[%inc priority_backpressure.py mark=publish %]

This implementation uses [asimpy][asimpy]'s [%g priority-queue "priority queue" %] class
to manage efficient eviction of low-priority messages.

## Delivery Guarantees {: #msgque-delivery}

Different message delivery systems provide different kinds of delivery guarantees:

[%g exactly-once "Exactly-once" %] delivery
:   This is the strongest guarantee: each message is processed exactly once.
    It is surprisingly difficult to achieve in distributed systems due to failures and network issues.

[%g at-most-once "At-most-once" %] delivery
:   This ensures that messages are delivered zero or one times,
    i.e., are never duplicated, but possibly lost.
    This is achieved by dropping messages when queues are full or when subscribers are unavailable.
    It's the weakest guarantee but the simplest and fastest to implement.

[%g at-least-once "At-least-once" %] delivery
:   This ensures every message is delivered, possibly multiple times.
    It acknowledgments: the broker keeps messages until subscribers confirm receipt.
    If a subscriber crashes before acknowledging,
    the broker redelivers to another subscriber or retries.

We can extend our broker to support at-least-once delivery with acknowledgments.
First,
we add an acknowledgment ID field to each message:

[%inc ack_broker.py mark=message %]

Next,
we have the broker keep track of how long to wait for acknowledgments
and of outstanding acknowledgments:

[%inc ack_broker.py mark=broker %]

When a message is published, the broker schedules a callback to check if it was acknowledged.
The lambda captures the acknowledgment ID and calls `_check_ack()` after the timeout:

[%inc ack_broker.py mark=publish %]

A subscriber using this broker calls `broker.acknowledge(message.ack_id)`
after successfully processing a message.
Messages not acknowledged within the timeout are redelivered.

[%inc ack_broker.py mark=acknowledge %]

At-least-once delivery makes redelivery possible,
so subscribers must be prepared to receive the same message more than once.
This is the **idempotence requirement**: processing a message twice must have the same effect as processing it once.

Consider a subscriber that increments a counter in a database when it receives an "order placed" message.
If the broker redelivers the message because the subscriber crashed before acknowledging,
the counter will be incremented a second time, double-counting the order.
The fix is to make the operation idempotent: check whether the order ID has already been processed
before incrementing, and skip the increment if so.
This "exactly-once processing" pattern—at-least-once delivery plus idempotent consumers—
is the standard way to achieve reliable message processing in production systems.
Exactly-once delivery at the broker level is theoretically possible but requires distributed transactions,
which are expensive and rarely worth the cost compared to idempotent consumers.

## Consumer Groups and Load Balancing {: #msgque-balance}

In production systems,
multiple instances of the same subscriber type often share the workload.
This is called a [%g consumer-group "consumer group" %]:
messages on a topic are distributed among group members rather than duplicated to each.
Here's a simple implementation:

[%inc consumer_group.py mark=consumer %]

It relies on helper process `_Distributor` to do the work:

[%inc consumer_group.py mark=distributor %]

This consumer group receives messages from the broker on a single queue,
then distributes them round-robin to individual consumers' queues.
Each consumer in the group processes a subset of the messages in parallel with its peers.
Real systems use more sophisticated load balancing algorithms,
such as weighted distribution,
least-loaded routing,
or partition-based assignment.

## Exercises {: #msgque-exercises}

1.  In the backpressure simulation, what happens if you increase the publisher's
    base interval to match the subscriber's processing time?
    What if you set the queue size to 1?
    Run both variations and describe the equilibrium behavior in each case.

2.  The priority broker evicts low-priority messages when the queue is full.
    Add a counter to track how many messages of each priority level were dropped.
    Run a simulation where the publisher sends equal numbers of high- and low-priority messages.
    What fraction of each priority level was dropped?
    (Starter: add `dropped_by_priority: dict` to the broker's `init`.)

3.  A subscriber crashes after dequeuing a message but before acknowledging it.
    In the acknowledgment broker, what happens to that message?
    Trace through `ack_broker.py` to find where the timeout fires and what it does.
    What would happen if the subscriber crashed again on the redelivered message?

4.  The consumer group uses round-robin distribution.
    Write a simulation where one consumer in a group is 10x slower than the others
    (it takes 10 time units to process each message instead of 1).
    Does round-robin distribute load evenly in this case?
    Propose a least-loaded distribution strategy and describe what state the distributor would need to track.

5.  The current broker does not persist messages to disk.
    If the broker process crashes, all queued messages are lost.
    Describe the changes needed to support durable messaging (messages survive broker restarts).
    What is the performance cost of each change?
