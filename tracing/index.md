**In Development**

If a monolithic application is slow,
we can profile a single process to find out why.
In a [%g microservice "microservices" %] architecture,
however,
a single request may touch many services,
each of which may cause multiple database queries and external API calls.
This makes it a lot harder to figure out exactly what's going on.

Distributed tracing solves this by tracking requests as they flow through the system.
A tracing systems assigns each request a unique ID,
which that request carries through every service it touches.
Each service operation records the work it does
along with timing information and other metadata.
Collecting and combining these records allows the tracing framework
to understand dependencies between services
and identify bottlenecks.

Distributed tracing has two key elements:

-   A [%g span "span" %] represents a single unit of work.
    Spans form a tree with its origin in a [%g root-span "root span" %];
    this tree represents the (distributed) call graph.

-   A [%g trace "trace" %] is complete journey of a request through the system,
    and is identified by a unique trace ID.
    A single trace may contain many spans.

[%g context-propagation "Context propagation" %] means
passing trace and span IDs between services so that they can be correlated.
Trace and span IDs are often propagated using [%g http-header "HTTP headers" %]:

```
X-Trace-Id: abc123
X-Span-Id: def456
X-Parent-Span-Id: ghi789
```

Tracing systems often use [%g sampling "sampling" %]
to record only a fraction of traces.
Doing this means that some questions cannot be answered after the fact,
but sampling reduces storage costs and,
more importantly,
prevents the tracing system from overwhelming the network.

Finally, tags and logs are metadata attached to spans for debugging.
Tags are values used for filtering and searching,
such as the [%g http-status-code "HTTP status code" %],
while logs are timestamped events such as a [%g cache-miss "cache miss" %]
or retry attempt.

## A Minimum Viable Decorator {: #tracing-decorator}

Suppose we want to write a method `handle_request()`
that performs some work in `do_work()`
in a traceable way.
If we add the tracing code directly in `handle_request()`
we wind up with something like this:

[%inc long_winded.py mark=service %]

That is 15 lines of tracing code for a simple function,
and those lines would have to be copied into every function we want to trace.
A better approach is to define a [%g decorator "decorator" %]
that adds tracing for us so that we can write:

[%inc short_winded.py mark=service %]

A minimum viable version of that decorator needs to do the following:

1.  Check for active traces.
    If no trace context exists or sampling is disabled,
    it just calls the function normally.
2.  Create a child span whose parent is the current span (if there is one).
3.  Propagate trace context for nested calls.
4.  Handle errors, i.e., catch exceptions and tag spans with error information.
5.  Clean up by finishing the current span and restoring the previous context.

None of this is particularly hard,
but it does require a fair bit of code.
First,
we create a [%g singleton "singleton" %] to hold the active trace context
and the [%g trace-collector "collector" %] where completed spans are to be sent.
(In production,
we would use [%g thread-local-storage "thread-local storage" %]
or [%g async-context-vars "async context variables" %] to storage this data.)

[%inc tracing_decorators.py mark=storage %]

We can now define the tracing decorator itself.
It's long,
but all of the steps are fairly straightforward:

[%inc tracing_decorators.py mark=traced %]

## Data Types {: #tracing-types}

We now need to double back and define the core types for distributed tracing.
`TraceContext` propagates between services:

[%inc tracing_types.py mark=context %]

`Span` tracks individual operations,
and has methods for adding tags and log entries
and to mark the span as completed:

[%inc tracing_types.py mark=span %]

Finally, `Trace` aggregates spans,
and has methods for adding spans and getting the overall duration of the trace:

[%inc tracing_types.py mark=trace %]

## Trace Collector

The collector is an active process
that receives spans from services and assembles them into traces.
When it runs,
it repeatedly gets a span from its incoming queue and processes it:

[%inc trace_collector.py mark=collector %]

To process a new span,
the collector either adds it to an existing trace
or creates a new one.
If the trace is now complete,
the collector moves it from the active set into the completed set:

[%inc trace_collector.py mark=process %]

## A Simple Service {: #tracing-service}

With all this machinery in place,
tracing a microservice is relatively straightforward:

[%inc simple_service.py mark=simple %]

`handle_request` is automatically traced;
`process_data` is also traced and becomes a child span.
No spans are created manually,
and error handling is automatic.

The client creates the root span manually (since it initiates the trace):

[%inc ex_decorators.py mark=client %]

The output shows that we are capturing what we wanted to:

[%inc ex_decorators.out %]

## Useful Data {: #tracing-useful}

The code we just built commits a cardinal sin:
it generates data in an undocumented, hard-to-parse ASCII format.
In most cases trace data will be consumed by other programs,
which will summarize and reorganize it
to make it comprehensible to human beings.
To support that,
we should always generate data in a structured format such as JSON,
and use a standard [%g schema "schema" %] instead of creating one of our own.

The [OpenTelemetry][opentelemetry] standard defines such a schema,
but it is notoriously complex.
The simplified subset generated by `json_collector.py` has:

-   a single resource per trace (OpenTelemetry supports multiple);
-   a single scope per resource (again, OpenTelemetry supports multiple);
-   one kind of span instead of the six that OpenTelemetry offers;
-   no links between spans; and
-   simplified status codes.

Even with these simplifications,
a simple example like the one below produces over 300 lines of pretty-printed output:

[%inc ex_json.py mark=client %]

A sample clause of this JSON looks like this:

[%inc ex_json.out head=52 %]

It isn't something anyone would browse for fun,
but (hopefully) everything needed to track down problems is there.

## Sampling {: #tracing-sampling}

Recording every trace in a high-traffic system is prohibitively expensive.
A service processing 10,000 requests per second produces 10,000 root spans per second,
plus all their children.
Sampling records only a fraction of traces and discards the rest.

Head-based sampling decides at the *start* of a trace—before any spans are created—
whether to record it:

[%inc sampled_tracer.py mark=sampler %]

The sampling decision is made once and propagated with the trace context.
Every service in the chain checks `ctx` before creating a span:
if `ctx` is `None`, no span is created, so unsampled requests have zero tracing overhead.

## Cross-Service Propagation {: #tracing-propagation}

The basic tracer stores context in a module-level variable.
This works in a single process but breaks across service boundaries.
The only correct way to propagate context between services is to include it
in the request itself—conventionally as HTTP headers.

`PropagatedRequest` carries the trace context as a field:

[%inc sampled_tracer.py mark=propagated_context %]

`SampledService` reads the context from the request and passes a child context
to any downstream service it calls:

[%inc sampled_tracer.py mark=sampled_service %]

**Thread safety and `contextvars`:**
In the basic tracer, `Storage` is a module-level singleton.
In a real async service, many coroutines run concurrently in the same process.
If two requests are being processed at the same time, both would read and write
the same `Storage._current_context`, causing one request's context to leak into the other.

Python's `contextvars.ContextVar` solves this:
each asyncio task automatically gets its own copy of a `ContextVar`.
When a new task is created (e.g., by `asyncio.create_task`), it inherits
the parent task's context at the moment of creation.
This means you can `set` a `ContextVar` in a request handler without
affecting any other concurrent request handler.
The pattern is:

```python
from contextvars import ContextVar

_active_context: ContextVar[TraceContext | None] = ContextVar(
    "_active_context", default=None
)

# In a traced function:
token = _active_context.set(new_context)
try:
    await some_work()
finally:
    _active_context.reset(token)   # restores previous value in this task
```

Our simulation uses a single event loop with cooperative scheduling,
so module-level state is safe.
But any production tracing library must use `ContextVar` (or thread-local storage)
to be correct under real concurrency.

## Exercises {: #tracing-exercises}

1.  Run the basic decorator example and count how many spans are produced.
    Now wrap the client in a sampler with rate=0.5 and run 10 requests.
    On average, how many traces are recorded?
    What is the variance?
    Why might a 50% sample rate still miss the single slowest request?

2.  The `SampledService` creates a child context and passes it to downstream services.
    Add a third service (Database) as a downstream of the second service.
    Run a sampled trace and verify that the span tree has three levels:
    Client → Service A → Service B → Database.
    Print the `parent_span_id` of each span to confirm the chain.

3.  The basic tracer stores context in a module-level variable.
    Write a scenario that demonstrates the concurrency bug:
    start two requests at the same time and print the `trace_id` that each service sees.
    Do both requests always see their own `trace_id`?
    (Hint: since asimpy is single-threaded, you may need to add a yield point.)

4.  Tail-based sampling buffers all spans for a trace and decides whether to keep them
    only after the root span completes (allowing it to always record slow requests).
    Sketch the data structure needed to buffer spans until the root span finishes.
    What is the maximum memory cost per in-flight request?

5.  The JSON collector (in `json_collector.py`) generates over 300 lines of output
    for a simple example.
    Write a summary function that takes the collector's completed traces and prints,
    for each trace: total duration, number of spans, and the name of the slowest span.
    (Starter: iterate `collector.completed_traces` and use `Trace.duration()`.)
