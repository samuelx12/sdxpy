"""Distributed tracing with sampling and cross-service context propagation.

This module addresses two gaps in the basic tracing implementation:

1. Sampling:
   Recording every trace is expensive—storage, bandwidth, and CPU.
   Real systems sample: they record a fraction of traces and discard the rest.
   Head-based sampling decides at the start of a trace whether to record it.
   Tail-based sampling buffers the trace and decides at the end (after seeing
   the latency), allowing it to always record slow or errored requests.
   We implement head-based sampling here because it is simpler and sufficient
   for most use cases.

2. Cross-service propagation:
   In a real microservices system, services run in different processes.
   The only way to propagate trace context is to include it in the request—
   conventionally as HTTP headers:
       X-Trace-Id: abc123
       X-Span-Id: def456
       X-Parent-Span-Id: ghi789
   We simulate this by attaching the context to messages rather than relying
   on a shared global variable.

3. Thread safety:
   The basic tracer uses a module-level variable for the active context.
   This is fine for single-threaded, event-driven code (like our asimpy
   simulations), but in a real async or multi-threaded service each
   concurrent request needs its own context.  Python 3.7+ provides
   `contextvars.ContextVar` for this:

       _active_span: ContextVar[TraceContext | None] = ContextVar(
           "_active_span", default=None
       )

   Each asyncio task (and each OS thread) automatically gets its own copy
   of a ContextVar, so context from one request cannot leak into another.
   Our simulation is single-threaded, so we use a simple dict keyed by
   service name instead—but the principle is the same.

    Head-based sampling uses a fixed probability per trace.
    Every span in a sampled trace is recorded; spans from unsampled traces
    are discarded immediately.

    Advantages: simple, low overhead, no buffering required.
    Disadvantages: slow/erroneous traces are as likely to be dropped as fast ones.
    For production use, tail-based sampling (buffer then decide) is more useful
    for diagnosing performance problems, but requires buffering all spans briefly.
