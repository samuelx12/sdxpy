**In Development**

In order for computers to coordinate actions,
they must agree on what time it is.
[%g ntp "Network Time Protocol" %] (NTP) enables this
by giving computers a way to synchronize their clocks over a network with millisecond precision.
NTP dates from 1985,
but has survived largely unchanged because it works so well.

The challenge of clock synchronization is that network communication takes time.
If a server sends you "the current time is 12:00:00",
by the time you receive that message,
it's no longer 12:00:00,
and the amount of delay depends on the state of the network.
NTP solves this with an algorithm that measures both the clock offset
(how far off your clock is) and the network delay.
It uses four timestamps:

| label | name | purpose |
| ----- | ---- | ------- |
| t1    | the client send time | when the client sends the request |
| t2    | the server receive time | when the server receives the request |
| t3    | the server transmit time | when the server sends the response |
| t4    | the client receive time | when the client receives the response |

From these four timestamps, NTP calculates:

```
offset = ((t2 - t1) + (t3 - t4)) / 2
delay = (t4 - t1) - (t3 - t2)
```

The offset tells you how to adjust your clock,
while the delay tells you how reliable this measurement is
(lower delays are more accurate).

These formulas rest on an assumption that is worth stating explicitly:
**the network delay is symmetric**, i.e., the time for the request to travel to the server
equals the time for the response to travel back.
Under this assumption, the client's transmission time is half the total round-trip time,
so we split `(t4 - t1)` evenly between outbound and inbound.
If the assumption holds and the server's processing time `(t3 - t2)` is negligible,
then `(t2 - t1) ≈ (t4 - t3)` and the offset formula gives the true clock difference.

In practice, network paths are often asymmetric—
packets may take different routes in each direction.
This asymmetry introduces an error bounded by half the difference in one-way delays.
On a LAN with sub-millisecond RTT the error is tiny;
on a satellite link with an asymmetric path it can be tens of milliseconds.
NTP clients mitigate this by collecting multiple samples and discarding outliers,
but they cannot eliminate the error entirely without hardware timestamping.

NTP organizes time servers into levels called [%g ntp-stratum "strata" %]:
Stratum 0 is reference clocks such as atomic clocks and GPS receivers.
Stratum 1 includes servers directly connected to stratum 0, which act as primary time servers.
Stratum 2 is servers that connect with stratum 1 servers, and so on.
This hierarchy prevents circular dependencies and allows the system to scale.
End-user computers typically sync with stratum 2 or 3 servers.

## Implementation {: #ntp-impl}

Our simulation starts with the NTP message structure:

[%inc ntp_message.py mark=ntpmessage %]

The message holds the four timestamps and includes methods to calculate offset and delay using the NTP formulas.

The NTP server receives requests, records timestamps t2 and t3, and sends responses back to clients.
In our simulation, the server's clock is accurate:
it uses `self.now`, which is the simulation's true time.
The `stratum` field indicates this server's level in the time hierarchy:

[%inc ntp_server.py mark=ntpserver %]

The NTP client is more complex because it must adjust its own clock.
The constructor stores the server queue,
sync interval,
simulated network delay,
and an initial clock offset that represents how far off the client starts:

[%inc ntp_client.py mark=client_init %]

The `run` method simply waits for each sync interval before calling `_sync_with_server`:

[%inc ntp_client.py mark=client_run %]

`_sync_with_server` executes one full NTP exchange.
It records the send time t1,
waits for the server's response containing t2 and t3,
records the receive time t4,
and then applies the calculated offset:

[%inc ntp_client.py mark=client_sync %]

The client maintains a `clock_offset` representing how far its local clock differs from true time.
When it syncs,
it calculates the offset using the NTP algorithm and adjusts its clock accordingly.
Notice that `get_local_time()` returns the client's view of time,
which may differ from simulation time until synchronization occurs.

## Running a Simulation

Let's see clock synchronization in action:

[%inc ex_usage.py mark=simulate %]

The output shows clients starting with different clock offsets—some fast, some slow—and
gradually converging toward the true time as they sync with the server.
After a few iterations, all clients are within milliseconds of true time.

[%inc ex_usage.out %]

## Stratum Hierarchy

In real NTP deployments, servers form a hierarchy.
Let's simulate this with a server:

[%inc ex_stratum.py mark=stratumserver %]

We also need a client for the stratum simulation:

[%inc ex_stratum.py mark=stratumclient %]

A stratum N server needs to both sync with stratum N-1 (as a client)
and serve stratum N+1 clients (as a server).
We implement this with two separate processes that share clock state via a dictionary.
The client process syncs with upstream and updates the shared clock offset.
The server process reads from the shared clock offset when responding to downstream requests.

[%inc ex_stratum.py mark=hierarchy %]

In this simulation,
stratum 1 servers sync with reference clocks (simulated as perfect time),
stratum 2 servers sync with stratum 1,
and end clients sync with stratum 2.
Synchronization error accumulates as you go down the hierarchy,
but it's still accurate enough for most purposes.
A stratum 3 client might be accurate to within a few milliseconds,
which is perfectly adequate for log timestamps or cache expiration.

Why does error accumulate?
At each stratum, the server applies the offset it calculated from its upstream.
That calculation already has some error (because the upstream is not perfectly accurate
and the network delay is not perfectly symmetric).
When the downstream server syncs with this slightly-off clock,
its own offset calculation adds another error on top.
The errors are not simply additive—they depend on network jitter and path asymmetry—
but in practice each additional stratum adds roughly 1–5 ms of error in a well-run network.
Stratum 2 servers are accurate to around 1–10 ms; stratum 3 to around 5–20 ms.
This is why NTP stops at stratum 15 and treats stratum 16 as "unsynchronized".

## Exercises {: #ntp-exercises}

1.  Run the basic simulation with network delay doubled.
    How many sync cycles does each client need to converge within 0.01 of true time?
    Now try halving the delay.
    What does this tell you about the relationship between network latency and sync accuracy?

2.  The offset formula assumes symmetric delay.
    Modify the client to use a one-way delay (simulating asymmetric routing)
    by passing different outbound and inbound delays.
    Specifically, set outbound delay to 0.1 and inbound delay to 0.5.
    What offset does the client calculate?
    What is the true offset?
    By how much does asymmetry mislead the client?
    (Starter: add `inbound_delay` and `outbound_delay` parameters to `NtpClient`.)

3.  A client that syncs once per interval will drift between syncs
    because real hardware clocks are not perfectly accurate.
    Add a `drift_rate` parameter to the client that adds a small error per time unit
    (e.g., 0.001 per unit).
    How does drift affect the client's accuracy between syncs?
    What sync interval keeps the client within 0.05 of true time given drift 0.001?

4.  In the stratum hierarchy simulation, what happens if the stratum-1 server is restarted
    with a large initial offset (say, +10)?
    Trace through how the error propagates to stratum-2 and then to the end clients.
    After how many sync cycles do the end clients recover?

5.  Real NTP clients query multiple servers and use a "best" algorithm
    to reject outliers before computing the offset.
    Simulate a misbehaving server that always returns an offset 5.0 higher than true time.
    Add a second honest server.
    Implement a simple two-server client that takes the offset from whichever server has the lower delay.
    Does this correctly identify and ignore the misbehaving server?
