**In Development**

[%b Dean2004 %] introduced the MapReduce framework,
which allowed programmers to perform many different data processing tasks
by using two abstractions called (as you might guess) map and reduce.
[Hadoop][hadoop], [Apache Spark][apache-spark], and other tools
embody the same model,
which is a good starting point for learning about distributed systems.

## The MapReduce Pattern {: #mapreduce-pattern}

MapReduce works by breaking computation into two phases.
The *map* phase transforms input records independently,
while the subsequent *reduce* phase combines results that have the same key.
Between these phases the framework handles shuffling data across machines,
sorting by key,
and managing failures.
Each MapReduce computation consists of:

1.  Input splitting: the input data is divided into chunks.
1.  Map phase: a user-supplied function is applied to each input record to produce key-value pairs.
1.  Shuffle: all values with the same key are grouped together and distributed to reducers.
1.  Reduce phase: the values associated with each key are processed to produce the final results.
1.  Output: the results are saved somewhere.

In order for this to work,
map operations must be independent,
i.e.,
there cannot be any shared state
so that the operations can be done anywhere, in any order.
Similarly,
the reduce operations must be associative and commutative
so that they can be applied in any order.
These two constraints enable parallelism and fault tolerance.

## Word Count {: #mapreduce-wordcount}

Let's start by showing how MapReduce is used,
and then show how it is implemented.
The classic MapReduce example counts how often each word occurs in a document.

[%inc ex_word_count.py %]

As this example shows,
the programmer writes two simple functions and runs a process to coordinate them.
The framework handles distribution, parallelization, and aggregation.

## Core Data Structures {: #mapreduce-datastructures}

Let's start with some dataclasses to represent the data flowing through the framework.
Input will be split into chunks for the map phase:

[%inc mr_types.py mark=map %]

Intermediate data will be partitioned for reducers:

[%inc mr_types.py mark=intermediate %]

And finally,
intermediate chunks will be reduced:

[%inc mr_types.py mark=reduce %]

<div class="callout" markdown="1">

The initial implementation of MapReduce contained a subtle bug.
Python's built-in function `hash` generates a [%g hash-code "hash code" %]
from a chunk of data.
That value is partially randomized:
it is the same within any run of a program,
but may differ from one run to the next.
This meant that different runs of our simulations
sent different chunks of data to different places,
which in turn meant that runs weren't reproducible.
To fix this,
we introduced our own hashing function:

[%inc mr_types.py mark=hash %]

</div>

## Worker Implementation {: #mapreduce-worker}

Worker processes execute both map and reduce tasks.
Each has a unique worker ID,
a queue of incoming tasks,
and a reference to the overall work coordinator:

[%inc mr_worker.py mark=worker %]

The code shown above also records a few simple statistics
and can simulate failure with a specified probability;
we will use this last propery when we look at fault tolerance.

When a worker runs,
it repeatedly gets a task from its queue and executes it.
If there's a simulated failure,
the worker reports that back to the coordinator instead:

[%inc mr_worker.py mark=run %]

Each map task consists of one or more records.
For simplicity's sake we assume each record needs the same processing time,
so after waiting that long,
the worker partitions the results
and sends them back to the coordinator:

[%inc mr_worker.py mark=map %]

Reducing works the same way:

[%inc mr_worker.py mark=reduce %]

## MapReduce Coordinator {: #mapreduce-coordinator}

The coordinator manages the entire lifecycle:
splitting input, dispatching tasks, collecting results, and handling failures by re-executing failed tasks.

[%inc mr_coordinator.py %]

Note that `run()` returns a coroutine by returning the result of `_execute()`;
this coroutine is awaited by the `Process` that the user writes.

## Combiner Functions {: #mapreduce-combiner}

A combiner is a local reduce that runs on each mapper's output before shuffling
in order to reduce network traffic.
Doing this can dramatically improve performance for operations like summation or counting.

To see why, consider the word-count example with the input "the cat sat on the mat".
Without a combiner, the mapper for this chunk emits six intermediate pairs:
`("the", 1), ("cat", 1), ("sat", 1), ("on", 1), ("the", 1), ("mat", 1)`.
All six travel over the network to the reducers.

With a combiner that runs the same reduce function locally,
the mapper first reduces these to `("the", 2), ("cat", 1), ("sat", 1), ("on", 1), ("mat", 1)`.
Now only five pairs cross the network, and the saving grows with repetition:
for a chunk of 10,000 words with a vocabulary of 500, the combiner might reduce 10,000 pairs
to 500, a 20x reduction in network traffic.

A combiner is only correct when the reduce function is commutative and associative
(the same requirement as the reduce phase itself).
Summation, counting, max, and min all qualify.
Average does not—`average(average(1,2), 3)` ≠ `average(1,2,3)`—so a combiner cannot be used
for averages without keeping both the sum and count separately.

[%inc coordinator_with_combiner.py %]

## Handling Stragglers with Speculative Execution {: #mapreduce-speculative}

Some workers may be stragglers due to hardware issues or resource contention.
MapReduce can accommodate this by launching backup copies of slow tasks.
The first copy to complete wins,
while others are discarded.
This is called [%g speculative-execution "speculative execution" %],
and ensures that one slow worker doesn't delay the entire job.

[%inc speculative_coordinator.py %]

## Fault Tolerance Simulation {: #mapreduce-fault}

A simple extension of speculative execution is [%g fault-tolerance "fault tolerance" %]:
the framework automatically retries failed tasks,
ensuring that computation completes despite failures.

[%inc ex_fault_tolerance.py %]

## In the Real World {: #mapreduce-real}

MapReduce's limitations led to the next-generation systems described in the introduction.
First, MapReduce writes intermediate data to disk between phases.
This is expensive for iterative algorithms of the kind used in machine learning,
and becomes more so when complex computation require multiple MapReduce jobs to be chained together.

Second, MapReduce has no data sharing:
there is no way to cache intermediate results in memory across jobs,
which can lead to redundant computation.
Finally, MapReduce is designed for batch processing:
real-time stream processing requires a different approach.

Even with these shortcomings,
MapReduce demonstrates how to build scalable distributed computation through simple abstractions.
The key principles are:

1.  Partitioning: data is automatically partitioned and distributed.
1.  Independent processing: Map tasks don't communicate, and reduce tasks are independent.
1.  Fault tolerance: Idempotent operations make it safe to re-execute tasks.
1.  Simplicity: Programmers write two functions, and the framework handles everything else.

## A Note on Hashing and Reproducibility {: #mapreduce-hashing}

The `IntermediateData.partition` method assigns each key to a reducer
using a hash function.
An earlier version of this code used Python's built-in `hash()`,
which meant that the examples produced different output every time they were run
even when `random.seed()` was called with the same value.
The reason is that Python randomizes string hashing on startup:
the environment variable `PYTHONHASHSEED` is set to a different random value
each time the interpreter starts,
so `hash("the")` returns a different integer in every process.
This is a security measure to prevent hash collision attacks,
but it means that `hash()` is not suitable for partitioning
when reproducibility matters.
The fix is to use `hashlib.md5` (or another deterministic hash function)
to convert keys to integers.
The result is not affected by `PYTHONHASHSEED`,
so the examples produce the same output every time.

## Exercises {: #mapreduce-exercises}

1.  Run the word-count example twice without calling `random.seed()`.
    Do the results change between runs?
    Now add `random.seed(42)` before the simulation and run it again.
    Are the results now reproducible?
    Why or why not—is the hash function the only source of non-determinism?

2.  The combiner reduces network traffic by pre-aggregating mapper output.
    Modify the word-count example to count how many key-value pairs the mapper produces
    and how many it would produce after combining.
    Use a corpus of 1000 words with a vocabulary of 50 distinct words
    and measure the reduction factor.

3.  The current implementation retries failed tasks until they succeed.
    What happens if a task always fails (e.g., because the input data is corrupt)?
    Add a maximum retry count to the coordinator and have it report a permanent failure
    after three attempts.
    (Starter: add a `retry_count: dict` to `MRCoordinator.__init__` and increment it in the failure handler.)

4.  Speculative execution launches a backup copy of a slow task.
    What happens if both the original and the backup succeed at almost the same time?
    Trace through `speculative_coordinator.py` to find where duplicate results are handled.
    Is there a window where the coordinator could accept both?

5.  MapReduce is described as unsuitable for iterative algorithms.
    Sketch how you would compute PageRank (which requires iterating until convergence)
    using multiple MapReduce jobs chained together.
    How many jobs would be needed for 10 iterations?
    What is the overhead compared to a system that keeps data in memory between iterations?
