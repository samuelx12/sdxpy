**In Development**

How do you distribute work
When you have hundreds or thousands of tasks to execute and a handful of CPU cores?
A naïve approach is to use a single queue,
but this creates a bottleneck,
since every worker must compete for access to that queue.

A [%g work-stealing "work-stealing" %] scheduler solves this problem through decentralization.
Each worker maintains a local [%g deque "deque" %] of tasks.
Workers execute tasks from one end of their own deque,
but if a worker runs out of tasks it can take some from the other end of another worker's deque.
This design minimizes [%g contention "contention" %] while providing some [%g load-balancing "load balancing" %],
and appears throughout high-performance computing.
[Go's runtime scheduler][go-scheduler] uses is to distribute goroutines across threads,
Java's [fork/join framework][java-fork-join] enables parallel divide-and-conquer algorithms,
and [Tokio][tokio] (Rust's async runtime) uses it to schedule [%g future "futures" %] across worker threads.

## The Work-Stealing Pattern {: #worksteal-pattern}

A work-stealing system has five parts:

1.  Each worker has a local deque of tasks.
1.  Those tasks are independent of each other.
1.  Workers pop tasks from the private end of their deque.
1.  Idle workers take tasks from the public end of other workers' deques.
1.  Running tasks can create new child tasks.

The key idea is asymmetry:
the owning worker operates on one end of their deque
(usually called the bottom)
while other workers (called thieves) steal from its other end (the top).
This reduces contention because owners and thieves don't compete for the same task
unless the queue is almost empty.

Let's start with the task representation:

[%inc task.py mark=task %]

Each task has an ID,
a duration to simulate CPU-bound work,
and an optional parent task ID for tracking task dependencies.

Each worker maintains a deque.
In our simulation, we'll use a simple list-based deque:

[%inc worker_deque.py mark=deque %]

A production system would use something more sophisticated than a simple Python list
to manage the deque,
but our simulation focuses on the algorithmic pattern rather than low-level synchronization.

A worker executes tasks from its local deque and steals when idle.
We start by setting up its members:

[%inc worker.py mark=worker %]

and then define its behavior:

[%inc worker.py mark=run %]

As the code above shows,
the worker continuously tries to execute tasks.
If its local deque is empty,
it attempts to steal from other workers.
If stealing fails,
it waits briefly before trying again.

Executing a task is relatively straightforward:

[%inc worker.py mark=execute %]

Stealing a task from another worker is somewhat more interesting.
The most important part is that we randomize the order in which we check the workers
in order to spread the load as evenly as possible:

[%inc worker.py mark=steal %]

## The Scheduler {: #worksteal-scheduler}

The scheduler coordinates workers and provides task submission:

[%inc scheduler.py mark=scheduler %]

We can create a simple simulation with load imbalance to see it in action:

[%inc ex_basic_ws.py mark=sim %]

The output shows workers executing tasks and stealing from each other when they run out of local work.
The steal rate shows how much load balancing occurred:

[%inc ex_basic_ws.out head=10 tail=7 %]

## Nested Task Spawning {: #worksteal-spawn}

A common extension of work-stealing is
to support [%g divide-and-conquer "divide-and-conquer" %] algorithms
by allowing tasks to spawn subtasks.
To explore this,
we can create a task generator:

[%inc task_generator.py mark=gen %]

and then create a worker that spawns subtasks with some random probability
(in our case, 30%):

[%inc worker_with_spawning.py mark=spawner %]

The final step is to write a scheduler that creates these workers:

[%inc scheduler_with_spawning.py mark=scheduler %]

Our simulation looks similar to our first one:

[%inc ex_spawning.py mark=sim %]

Its output shows that spawning helps balance the load
even with irregular task creation:

[%inc ex_spawning.out head=20 tail=8 %]

## Load Balancing Strategies {: #worksteal-balance}

What effect does target selection strategy have on performance?
To find out,
we can create a worker that uses adaptive target selection,
i.e.,
that steals tasks from the largest of its peers' queues:

[%inc adaptive_worker.py mark=worker %]

Unsurprisingly,
this leads to better load balancing:

[%inc ex_adaptive.out head=20 tail=8 %]

## Task Granularity {: #worksteal-granularity}

The [%g granularity "granularity" %] of tasks—i.e.,
how much work is in each one—has a big impact on performance.
Many small tasks create lots of scheduling overhead,
while a few large tasks cause load imbalance.
Using the code we have written so far,
we can easily experiment with the effect of changing task size:

[%inc ex_granularity.out %]

## Parent-Child Join {: #worksteal-join}

The current workers spawn child tasks and move on immediately.
For divide-and-conquer algorithms,
the parent usually needs to wait for all children to finish before it can complete its own work—
this is the [%g fork-join "fork-join" %] pattern.

`JoiningWorker` implements this by suspending the parent at the join point
and resuming it only when all children have signaled completion:

[%inc joining_worker.py mark=joining %]

Each child posts to the parent's join queue when it finishes;
the parent counts down to zero and then resumes.

**Hidden complexity:** In a real multi-threaded work-stealing runtime
(Go's goroutine scheduler, Java's ForkJoin, Tokio in Rust),
the parent cannot simply `await` a queue—
doing so would block the OS thread, preventing that thread from stealing and running other tasks.
Instead, the runtime saves the parent's continuation (the code to run after the join)
and suspends the parent without blocking the thread.
The thread is free to steal and execute other tasks while the parent waits.
When the last child completes, it decrements an atomic counter;
if the counter reaches zero, it schedules the parent's continuation back onto the deque.
This requires lock-free atomic operations on the counter and careful memory ordering
to ensure the parent sees all of the children's writes before it resumes.
Our simulation sidesteps all of this with asimpy's event-driven, single-threaded model,
but students building a real scheduler must address it.

## Preventing Livelock {: #worksteal-livelock}

Our implementations demonstrate the core concepts of work stealing,
but production systems go further.
In particular,
they try to prevent [%g livelock "livelock" %] by limiting how long a worker searches for victims,
and use exponential backoff rather than spinning continuously when trying to steal work.

Livelock in work-stealing looks like this:
all workers are simultaneously idle (no local tasks),
all try to steal from each other at the same instant,
all fail (because everyone is already popping from the top),
all wait and retry,
and the cycle repeats.
The fix is:
(1) cap the number of steal attempts per idle cycle so workers don't spin-steal forever, and
(2) use exponential backoff—after each failed steal attempt, wait twice as long before trying again.
The backoff period is bounded (typically at 1–10 ms) so a newly available task is still noticed quickly.

## Exercises {: #worksteal-exercises}

1.  In the basic simulation, vary the number of workers from 2 to 8
    while keeping the total number of tasks fixed at 20.
    How does the steal rate change?
    At what worker count does adding more workers stop helping?

2.  The deque uses a Python list,
    which would require a lock if multiple threads accessed it simultaneously.
    Find the `push_bottom`, `pop_bottom`, and `steal_top` methods in `worker_deque.py`.
    For each method, identify which operation would be unsafe if two threads called it concurrently
    without a lock (e.g., what can go wrong if `steal_top` and `pop_bottom` run at the same time?).

3.  Run the joining worker simulation.
    Find a task in the output where the parent waits for children.
    How much longer does the parent take to complete compared to what it would take without children?
    What determines the critical path length when tasks have children?

4.  Add exponential backoff to the basic worker's steal loop.
    After each failed steal attempt, double the wait time (starting at 0.05, capped at 0.5).
    Reset the wait time to 0.05 on a successful steal.
    Compare the total simulation time and idle time against the baseline.
    (Starter: add `backoff = 0.05` to the worker's `init` and update it in `try_steal`.)

5.  The adaptive worker steals from the largest queue.
    Compare its steal count and total simulation time against the random-target worker
    on a workload where tasks arrive in bursts (e.g., all tasks for worker 0 arrive at t=0,
    all tasks for worker 1 arrive at t=5).
    Does adaptive selection help or hurt in this case?
