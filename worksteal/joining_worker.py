class JoiningWorker(Worker):
    """Worker that tracks parent-child relationships and waits for children.

    When a task spawns children, it does not complete until all children have
    finished.  This models the fork-join pattern used in parallel divide-and-conquer
    algorithms such as merge sort or parallel tree traversal.

    Hidden complexity note:
    In a real work-stealing runtime (e.g. Go's goroutine scheduler or Java's
    ForkJoin framework) this wait is implemented with a *continuation*: the
    parent task is suspended at the join point and placed back onto the deque
    so other workers can continue making progress.  The parent only resumes
    once a counter of outstanding children reaches zero.

    Our simulation uses asimpy queues to implement the same idea: the parent
    awaits a completion queue, and each child posts to that queue when it
    finishes.  Because asimpy is single-threaded (event-driven), there are no
    race conditions, but in a real concurrent system the counter decrement must
    be atomic to avoid the parent waking up before all children are done.
