**In Development**

When you book a flight, reserve a hotel, and rent a car in a single transaction,
what happens if the car rental fails but the flight and hotel are already reserved?
In a monolithic system you would roll back the entire transaction,
but in a microservices architecture using separate databases for flights, hotels, and cars,
traditional ACID transactions don't work.

The [%g saga "Saga pattern" %] solves this
by breaking long-running transactions into a sequence of local transactions,
each with a [%g compensation "compensating action" %] to undo its effects if the overall transaction fails.
This enables distributed transactions without distributed locks,
maintaining eventual consistency while handling failures gracefully.

The pattern is a response to the fact that distributed transactions using two-phase commit don't scale.
Sagas trade immediate consistency for availability and fault tolerance,
but as we'll see,
bring constraints of their own.

## The Saga Pattern {: #saga-pattern}

A Saga is a sequence of local transactions,
each of which updates a single service and publishes an event or message to trigger the next transaction.
If a transaction fails,
the Saga executes compensating transactions to undo the changes made by preceding transactions.

Unlike two-phase commit,
which uses prepare/commit phases and locks,
Sagas commit each step immediately and use compensation to handle failures.
The pattern can be implemented in one of two ways.

-   Orchestration:
    a central coordinator tells each service what to do.
    This is easier to understand and monitor,
    but the coordinator is a coordination point.

-   Choreography:
    each service listens for events and decides what to do next.
    Its decentralization makes it more scalable,
    but also makes it harder to understand and monitor.

Whichever approach is used,
each forward step must be define a backward compensation that is retryable and idempotent.
The first requirement is self-explanatory;
the second means that the compensation has the same effect on the system
no matter how many times it is tried.
(A simple example is multiplying a value by 1:
it can be done any number of times, but always has the same result.)

Compensations must be idempotent because it's possible for a workflow to go forward and backward several times.
Compensations can be implemented as negative transitions,
but it is often easier to implement them by saving the state before the transition,
such as the account balance,
and then restoring that state.
These approaches can be mixed together in a single workflow
depending on which is easiest to use with a particular external service.

## Core Data Structures {: #saga-struct}

Let's build a travel booking saga with flights, hotels, and car rentals.
We start by defining the states that the saga as a whole
and the individual transactions
can be in:

[%inc saga_types.py mark=enum %]

We then create structures to represent the saga's state  machine.
Each step has a forward transaction and a backward compensation.

[%inc saga_types.py mark=sagatypes %]

## Service Implementations {: #saga-services}

We can now implement the three microservices involved in the saga.
Each service manages its own local state
and provides both forward (book) and backward (cancel) operations.
The flight service manages seat availability;
we have given it a 10% random failure rate to simulate real-world unreliability:

[%inc booking_services.py mark=flight_service %]

The hotel service follows the same pattern with a 15% failure rate and room inventory:

[%inc booking_services.py mark=hotel_service %]

Finally,
the car rental service has a 30% failure rate to demonstrate more frequent compensation:

[%inc booking_services.py mark=car_service %]

Each service is autonomous:
it manages its own database and can succeed or fail independently.

## Orchestration-Based Saga {: #saga-orch}

The orchestrator coordinates the sequence of transactions.
It stores references to each service and processes requests from a queue:

[%inc saga_orchestrator.py mark=orch_init %]

When a booking request arrives,
`execute_saga` builds the list of steps and drives them forward,
triggering compensation if any step fails:

[%inc saga_orchestrator.py mark=orch_execute %]

The forward pass runs each step in sequence,
stopping immediately on the first failure:

[%inc saga_orchestrator.py mark=orch_forward %]

The compensation pass runs in reverse,
undoing each completed step:

[%inc saga_orchestrator.py mark=orch_compensate %]

The compensation pass runs in reverse order—this is not an implementation detail but a logical requirement.
If the forward steps are A → B → C and C fails,
we must compensate B before compensating A.
Compensating A first could leave the system in a state where A's compensation
removes a resource that B's compensation still needs to reference.
Reversing the order ensures that each compensation sees the same state
as the step that originally succeeded.

## Basic Orchestration Example

Let's see orchestration in action:

[%inc ex_saga.py mark=orchestratedexample %]
[%inc ex_saga.out %]

## Choreography-Based Saga {: #saga-choreo}

In orchestration, the orchestrator is a single point of failure:
if it crashes mid-saga, the saga is stuck.
Choreography avoids this by removing the central coordinator entirely.
Instead, each service listens for events and decides what to do next.

The event bus routes events to subscribers:

[%inc saga_choreography.py mark=event_bus %]

Each service subscribes to the events it cares about.
The flight service listens for `"booking_started"` and `"hotel_compensated"`:

[%inc saga_choreography.py mark=choreographed_flight %]

The hotel service listens for `"flight_booked"` (forward step)
and `"car_booking_failed"` (trigger for its own compensation):

[%inc saga_choreography.py mark=choreographed_hotel %]

The car service is the last step,
so it triggers the compensation chain when it fails:

[%inc saga_choreography.py mark=choreographed_car %]

The compensation chain in choreography works the same way as in orchestration—reverse order—
but the ordering is *implicit* in the event subscriptions rather than explicit in a loop.
The car service publishes `"car_booking_failed"`,
which the hotel service receives and handles before publishing `"hotel_compensated"`,
which the flight service receives and handles last.
This event chain enforces the required reverse order automatically.

**Orchestrator crash and persistence:**
In choreography, there is no orchestrator to crash,
but each service can still crash while processing an event.
A service must acknowledge the event only after it has successfully committed its local transaction.
If it crashes before acknowledging, the event bus redelivers the event (at-least-once semantics),
and the service's handler must be idempotent.
In orchestration, the orchestrator must persist the saga state (which steps have completed)
to durable storage before driving each step forward.
Without persistence, an orchestrator crash means starting the saga over from scratch,
which could double-book resources.
Real orchestrators (like AWS Step Functions or Temporal) store the saga state in a database
and replay from the last checkpoint on restart.

## Exercises {: #saga-exercises}

1.  Run the orchestration example several times (without fixing the random seed).
    In what fraction of runs does the car booking fail?
    When it fails, does the hotel always get compensated?
    Add a counter to verify that the number of successful compensations equals
    the number of completed forward steps whenever the saga fails.

2.  The compensation order is reversed in `execute_compensation`.
    Change it to run in forward order (same order as the forward steps)
    and run a scenario where the hotel booking succeeds but car booking fails.
    What state are the flight and hotel bookings in after compensation?
    Why is this wrong?

3.  The car rental service has a 30% failure rate.
    This means roughly 30% of sagas will fail at the car step.
    Add a retry to the orchestrator: if the car booking fails, try it again once before compensating.
    Does this change the success rate?
    What problem could retrying introduce if the service is not idempotent?

4.  In choreography, the compensation chain is enforced by event subscriptions.
    Draw the event flow for a successful booking (all three services succeed)
    and a failed booking (car fails after hotel and flight succeed).
    Label each event and arrow.
    What events are published in each scenario?

5.  Suppose the hotel service crashes after booking the hotel but before publishing `"hotel_booked"`.
    What happens in the choreography scenario?
    Will the flight ever be compensated?
    What mechanism would be needed to detect and recover from this situation?
