**In Development**

Every time you visit a website or send an email,
your computer translates a human-readable name like "www.example.com"
into an IP addresses like "192.0.2.1".
[%g dns "Domain Name System" %] (DNS) is what makes this possible.
DNS is a distributed database,
and is one of the internet's most critical infrastructure components.
Among other things,
it enables service mobility:
a website can change servers and IP addresses without users noticing,
because the DNS mapping can be updated.

## How DNS Works

DNS is a hierarchical, distributed database that handles over a trillion queries per day.
Instead of one central server knowing all domain names,
which couldn't possibly scale,
the work is distributed across millions of servers organized in a tree structure:

-   13 [%g root-server "root servers" %]
    (though there are actually many more physical servers).
-   [%g tld "Top-level domain" %] (TLD) servers for `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, etc.
-   Authoritative name servers specific to each domain like `example.com`.
-   [%g recursive-resolver "Recursive resolvers" %],
    such as your ISP's DNS server or public DNS like 8.8.8.8.

When you look up `www.example.com`, your computer asks a recursive resolver, which may:

-   ask a root server "where's `.com`?"
-   ask the `.com` server "where's `example.com`?"
-   ask the `example.com` server "what's `www.example.com`?"
-   return the answer to you

This process is called recursive resolution.
It scales because no single server needs to know everything.
Instead,
each server knows its piece of the hierarchy and where to find the next level.

DNS would be unusably slow if every lookup required multiple round-trips through the hierarchy.
The solution is caching:
resolvers remember answers for a period referred to as [%g ttl "Time to Live" %] (TTL).
Popular domains like wikipedia.org are cached at every level
so that most queries are answered from cache in milliseconds.
This ensures that root servers handle surprisingly few queries
despite being at the top of the hierarchy.
It is also why changing a DNS record doesn't take effect immediately:
old values persist in caches until their TTL expires.

## Implementation {: #dns-impl}

DNS stores different types of records.
Our implementation will focus on A and CNAME records, which handle most web traffic.
As in previous chapters,
we start by enumerating the different types of records:

[%inc dns_message.py mark=recordtype %]

and then define a DNS resource record:

[%inc dns_message.py mark=dnsrecord %]

We also need to define the structure of queries and responses:

[%inc dns_message.py mark=dnsquery %]
[%inc dns_message.py mark=dnsresponse %]

The next step is to create the authoritative DNS server.
The constructor registers the zone this server is authoritative for and creates its record store.
`add_record` lets callers populate the zone before the simulation starts:

[%inc authoritative_server.py mark=auth_init %]

The `run` loop receives queries and builds responses.
If the query domain ends in this server's zone,
the server looks up the record directly;
it also follows CNAME chains to resolve aliases to their target A records:

[%inc authoritative_server.py mark=auth_run %]

The recursive resolver is more complex because it must cache and coordinate with authoritative servers.
A `CacheEntry` wraps a record with its expiry time:

[%inc recursive_resolver.py mark=cacheentry %]

The resolver's constructor sets up the cache and tracks hit and miss statistics:

[%inc recursive_resolver.py mark=resolver_init %]

The `run` loop checks the cache before forwarding to an authoritative server.
On a cache miss it calls `_resolve_recursive`, then stores the results:

[%inc recursive_resolver.py mark=resolver_run %]

`_check_cache` filters out expired entries and returns `None` on a complete miss.
`_cache_records` stores records with expiry times computed from each record's TTL:

[%inc recursive_resolver.py mark=resolver_cache %]

`_resolve_recursive` finds the authoritative server
whose zone suffix matches the query domain most specifically,
then forwards the query and returns the response.
Each cached entry has an expiration time based on the record's TTL.

[%inc recursive_resolver.py mark=resolver_resolve %]

Our simplified resolver directly contacts authoritative servers.
Real DNS resolvers walk the hierarchy starting from root servers,
but the principle is the same:
cache aggressively, query only when necessary.

## Clients {: #dns-client}

The DNS client wraps a response queue and a query counter:

[%inc dns_client.py mark=client_init %]

`lookup` constructs a query, sends it to the resolver, and prints the response:

[%inc dns_client.py mark=client_lookup %]

Clients send queries to recursive resolvers and wait for responses.
In real systems,
clients also cache locally and can query multiple resolvers for redundancy.

## Running a Simulation

Let's see DNS resolution in action by building a client:

[%inc ex_usage.py mark=testclient %]

We can now create the overall simulation:

[%inc ex_usage.py mark=simulate %]

The output shows that the first lookup of `www.example.com` is a cache miss,
necessitating a query to the authoritative server,
but the second lookup is a cache hit.
Different domains are cache misses until they're cached,
and the cache hit rate improves as the simulation runs.
In other words,
the first user to look up a domain pays the full resolution cost,
but subsequent users (or repeated lookups) get instant responses.

[%inc ex_usage.out %]

`ex_hierarchy.py` is a more complex simulation
that demonstrates several key properties of DNS,
including the use of multiple resolvers,
load distribution,
and the effectiveness of multiple caches.
Its output shows how the cache hit rate increases over time as more domains get cached.

## Hierarchical Resolution {: #dns-hier}

Our simplified resolver jumps directly to the best-matching authoritative server.
Real DNS resolvers cannot do this: they only know about the root servers at startup
and must walk the delegation chain to find the authoritative server for a new domain.

`HierarchicalResolver` implements this:

[%inc hierarchical_resolver.py mark=hier_init %]

Its `_walk_hierarchy` method starts at the root server,
follows NS referrals until it reaches an authoritative server, and returns the answer:

[%inc hierarchical_resolver.py mark=hier_walk %]

The first query for `www.example.com` requires two round-trips—one to the root, one to `.com`—
before reaching `example.com`'s authoritative server.
All subsequent queries for anything in `example.com` can skip this walk because the answers are cached.

## Negative Caching {: #dns-negative}

The `HierarchicalResolver` also caches negative responses (NXDOMAIN):

[%inc hierarchical_resolver.py mark=hier_negative %]

Without negative caching, every lookup of a non-existent domain (a typo, a deleted record)
results in a full hierarchy walk—one round-trip to the root, one to the TLD, one to the authoritative server.
Caching "this domain does not exist" for the TTL specified in the zone's SOA record
means that repeated lookups of the same nonexistent name are answered locally.
This is especially important for protecting authoritative servers from DNS amplification attacks,
where an attacker repeatedly queries nonexistent subdomains to exhaust server resources.

## Real-World Considerations

Our implementation simplifies several DNS complexities:

-   Hierarchy walking:
    The `HierarchicalResolver` above implements the basic walk.
    Real resolvers also handle glue records (A records for name servers embedded in referral responses)
    so they don't need a second hierarchy walk just to resolve the name server's IP address.

-   Multiple answers:
    DNS records can have multiple values (like multiple A records for load balancing).
    Real clients choose among them.

-   [%g negative-cache "Negative caching" %]:
    DNS caches "this domain doesn't exist" responses to avoid repeatedly querying for non-existent domains.

-   Anycast:
    Root servers use anycast (many servers sharing one IP address)
    to distribute load and improve availability.

-   TTL selection:
    Low TTLs mean changes propagate quickly but increase query load.
    High TTLs reduce load but slow down changes.

The most important omission in our implementation,
however,
is security.
DNS was designed without it;
[%g dnssec "DNSSEC" %] adds cryptographic signatures to prevent spoofing and cache poisoning.

## Exercises {: #dns-exercises}

1.  In the basic simulation, look up the same domain three times in a row.
    On which lookups is the cache hit?
    Now look up a domain whose TTL is 1 second, wait 2 seconds, and look it up again.
    What happens?
    (Hint: check how `CacheEntry.is_expired` uses the simulation clock.)

2.  The simplified resolver matches the *longest* zone suffix.
    For example, `api.example.com` would match `example.com` before `.com`.
    Construct a test with zones `"."`, `"com"`, and `"example.com"`.
    Query for `api.example.com` and trace which server handles it and why.

3.  Negative caching stores a sentinel record with value `"NXDOMAIN"`.
    Simulate a sequence where a domain genuinely does not exist,
    then (after the negative TTL expires) a record is added for it and queried again.
    Does the hierarchical resolver eventually return the correct answer?
    What would happen if the negative TTL were longer than the positive TTL?

4.  Real DNS resolvers query multiple root servers for redundancy and choose the fastest.
    Modify `HierarchicalResolver` to accept a list of root server queues
    and send the query to the first one that responds.
    (Starter: use `asimpy.FirstOf` to wait on multiple queues.)

5.  DNS cache poisoning is an attack where a malicious responder injects a false record
    into a resolver's cache.
    In our simulation, what would happen if an attacker intercepted the resolver's query
    and replied with a forged IP address before the real authoritative server responded?
    What does DNSSEC do to prevent this, and at what cost?
