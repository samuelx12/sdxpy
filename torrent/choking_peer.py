"""BitTorrent peer with choking/unchoking algorithm and piece verification.

This module implements two features that the simplified peer omits:

1. Choking algorithm:
   Each peer maintains "slots" for the peers it uploads to.
   It prefers to upload to peers that upload back (tit-for-tat),
   keeping its top 4 uploaders unchoked.
   Every 30 seconds it also "optimistically unchokes" one random choked peer,
   giving new peers a chance to prove themselves.

2. Piece verification:
   After downloading a piece, the peer checks its SHA-1 hash against
   the expected hash in the torrent metadata.
   A corrupted or malicious piece is discarded and re-requested.
   This is what the `piece_hashes` field in `TorrentMetadata` is for.
